## About  

Worldtrip was made as a course project for Rocketseat's ReactJS course. The goal was to implement a 2-page layout using NextJS and Chakra-UI. You can find the original layout [here](https://www.figma.com/file/roePgjiXKaMdAkaGmuwOZV/Worldtrip).

As I wanted to experiment more with NextJS, I also added support for multiple languages and animations.

Overall, this project really helped me a lot to understand how to use NextJS to generate pages with external data, and how it allows developers to build scalable and performant web aplications.

## Features
